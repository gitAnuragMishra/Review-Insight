# Review-Insight
Automatically summarize product details and analyze customer sentiment for informed purchase decisions


### Challenges
- scraping directly from an amazon link is proving to be difficult without a paid proxy service. Getting IP blocked after each subsequent request 
- Scraping Amazon reviews can be tricky due to Amazon's strong anti-scraping measures, including rate limiting and CAPTCHA challenges without a paid proxy service.
- Thus, for the time being, we shall download the link as an html file and work with it
- use selenium to automate the process or develop some web scrapper


### Progress

- ui and pages are built
- data extraction possible that too on multiple files
- Now, to include a text summariser for product description and reviews
- Use the built sentiment analyser
- Give the verdict


## Text summary
